# LeetCode-DSA-Pareto-Set

This repository contains my personal solutions to the 49 essential LeetCode problems from **The Pareto Problem Set**. The goal is to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms by mastering the core patterns that frequently appear in technical interviews.

This project serves as the foundational milestone in my journey to master DSA.

## My Problem-Solving Methodology

To ensure a deep understanding of each problem, I follow a structured, three-step approach that mirrors the process of a real technical interview:

1.  **Brute Force:** The initial, straightforward solution to prove my understanding of the problem.
2.  **Optimized:** An improved version that addresses the inefficiencies of the first approach.
3.  **Optimal:** The most efficient solution in terms of time and space complexity, representing the target answer in an interview setting.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, one for each problem. Each folder is named using the convention `Problem-Number-Problem-Name-Category` and contains three separate C++ files corresponding to the three solution approaches.

All documentation, including complexity analysis, logic, and pseudocode, is included directly within the comments of each source code file.
