# 🧠 LeetCode DSA Pareto Set

> **"Master the 20% of problems that give you 80% of the results."**

This repository contains my **solutions to the 49 essential LeetCode problems** from **The Pareto Problem Set** — carefully selected to cover the **core DSA patterns** that frequently appear in technical interviews.

It serves as the **foundation milestone** in my journey to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** through **structured practice** and **deep understanding**.

## 🚀 My Problem-Solving Methodology

Each problem is solved through a **4-step process**, designed to mirror a **real technical interview**:

1. **🧩 Brute Force:**  
   The most straightforward C++ solution — to prove understanding of the problem statement.

2. **⚡ Optimized:**  
   An improved version that addresses inefficiencies in time and/or space.

3. **🏆 Optimal:**  
   The most efficient C++ implementation — balancing clarity and performance.

4. **🌀 Flowchart:**  
   A visual representation of the optimal solution’s logic, created using **draw.io**.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each problem has its **own folder**, named using the following convention:

```
Problem-Number-Problem-Name-Category
```

Each folder includes:

- `brute_force.cpp`
- `optimized.cpp`
- `optimal.cpp`
- `flowchart.png` & `.drawio`
- Documentation and analysis inside code comments (pseudocode, logic, and complexity).

Example:

```
01-Contains-Duplicate-Arrays/
    ├── brute_force.cpp
    ├── optimized.cpp
    ├── optimal.cpp
    └── flowchart.png
    └── flowchart.drawio
```
