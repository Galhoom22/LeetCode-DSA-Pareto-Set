LeetCode-DSA-Pareto-Set
This repository contains my solutions to the 49 essential LeetCode problems from The Pareto Problem Set. The goal is to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms by mastering the core patterns that frequently appear in technical interviews.

This repository serves as the foundational milestone in my journey to master DSA.

My Problem-Solving Methodology
To ensure a deep understanding of each problem, I follow a structured, four-step approach that mirrors the process of a real technical interview:

1.  Brute Force: The initial, straightforward C++ solution to prove my understanding of the problem.
2.  Optimized: An improved C++ version that addresses the inefficiencies of the first approach.
3.  Optimal: The most efficient C++ solution in terms of time and space complexity.
4.  Flowchart: A visual representation of the optimal solution's logic, created using draw.io.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders, one for each problem. Each folder is named using the convention Problem-Number-Problem-Name-Category and contains the corresponding C++ solution files and the flowchart for the optimal approach.

All documentation, including complexity analysis, logic, and pseudocode, is included directly within the comments of each source code file.

Solution Template
The following template is used within the comments of every solution file to ensure consistency and thoroughness.
